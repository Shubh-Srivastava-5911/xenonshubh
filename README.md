About my XenonStack technical assessment task.
theme - registration for space missions

I have a web app for registering users for upcoming space missions and other opportunities, I used reactJS, html, css, php (for database connection) and mySQL.

It consists a login page from which we can go to home page (main) after entering credentials.
In case of new registration, user can click register button for new sign up, his/her data (name, email, phone, continent) gets stored in mySQL relation and user will get directed to home page. It also have a contact us page for more information.

I have used VScode and xampp in making of this project.

here are some screenshots of my application :
